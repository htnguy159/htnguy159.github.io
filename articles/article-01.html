        	<h2> Full Stack Web App: Budgeting App </h2>
            <p> I have selected to do a budgeting app for my Developing Advanced Web Applications course. I chose this project because I wanted to work on something that I know I would like to use outside of this course. I find that this app would be helpful in recognizing spending habits and taking that knowledge to better manage finances. </p>

            <p> Tracking expenses and having visuals based on user's data would help to better grasp how much money is spent in a month. If you're surprised by the amound you spend at coffee shops, you may consider investing in a coffee machine. If you notice how you much you spend on streaming services, you might consider dropping a subscriptions that you don't use that often. This budgeting app would make identifying these habits and possible adjustments easier for users! </p>

            <h4> The idea is to keep track of user expenses and provide monthly reports to show spending habits.</h4>

            <h2> Proposed Features: </h2>
            <ul>
            	<li>Calculating the total amount of expenses</li>
            	<li>Splitting expenses into categories</li>
            	<li>Subtract expenses from income to show remaining budget</li>
            	<li>Display graphs to give a visual of all the data</li>
            	<li>Users can view expenses by all, a specific category, or date</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Abstract </h2>
            <p> Our budgeting app is intended to help users track and visualize how much they spend to manage their finances better. We plan to split purchases into categories to help users keep track of what they are spending on and include graphs to make the data easier to understand. Our target audience is for anyone who would like to organize their finances to better manage their money. Some basic features we plan to have on our app are splitting expenses into categories and calculating the total amount, subtracting expenses from income to show the remaining budget, graphs to give a visual of all the data, and allowing users to view expenses by all, category, or date.
 			</p>
 			<p> Our frontend requirements include user friendly graphics and interface to make it simple to navigate and an easy way to collect user input for expenses(description, price, date). Our backend requirements include taking the userâ€™s input to develop graphs and tables. Our database will contain the data(expenses) supplied by the user, the total of expenses for each month, the dates, and the different categories.</p>

            <p> For this project, I will be working with Phuong-Anh who I met at the University of New Orleans in my very first Computer Science course. She is a third year CS major, impressively organized, and great at problem solving. </p>
